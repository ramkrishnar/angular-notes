property binding:
Property binding simply means you're passing data from the component class and
setting the value of a given element in the view. Property binding is one way, in that the data is transferred from the component to 
the class.

The benefit of property binding is that it allows you to control element property values from the component and change them whenever needed.
ex:
component class:
allowserver=false;
constructor(){
setTimeOut(()=>{this.allowserver=true},2000)
}
template:
<button [disabled]="!allowserver"></disabled>

Event binding:
---------------
With the [] we are binding to an input of a Component.

With the () we are binding to an output of a Component.
ex:
app.component.ts:
server='server not created';
onCreateServer(){
this.server='server created';
}
template:-
----------
<button (click)="onCreateServer()"></disabled>
<p>{{server}}</p>
